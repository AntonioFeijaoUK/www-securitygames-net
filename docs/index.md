Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word "hacker":

1) an adherent of the technology and programming subculture; see hacker culture.

2) someone who is able to subvert [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security).  
  If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can also be called a [cracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker).
